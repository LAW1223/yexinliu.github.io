I'm a second year Mphil student from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ling Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SReb2csAAAAJ&hl=en) of VLSLAB from [Information Hub]([https://cs.pku.edu.cn/](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/)). My research interest includes computer vision, MLLMs, and transfer learning. 

I'm currently immersed in my internship journey within the Data Intelligence group at BAAI, where I have the privilege of being under the guidance of the Principal Investigator [Zhao Bo](https://www.bozhao.me/).
